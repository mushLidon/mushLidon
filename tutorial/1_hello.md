# Getting Started

Make sure you have both [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and at
least version 3.5 of Python before starting. On Linux or MacOS X you can install
directly using pip. If you are on Windows you can still develop and use
Japronto with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#/on-macos-and-windows).

Installing
----------

On Linux and OSX install Japronto with `python3 -m pip install japronto`.
On Windows or if you simply prefer Docker pull Japronto image with `docker pull japronto/japronto`.

Creating your Hello world app
-----------------------------

Copy and paste following code into a file named `hello.py`:

  ```python
  # examples/1_hello/hello.py
  from japronto import Application


  # Views handle logic, take request as a parameter and
  # returns Response object back to the client
  def hello(request):
      return request.Response(text='Hello world!')


  # The Application instance is a fundamental concept.
  # It is a parent to all the resources and all the settings
  # can be tweaked here.
  app = Application()

  # The Router instance lets you register your handlers and execute
  # them depending on the url path and methods
  app.router.add_route('/', hello)

  # Finally start our server and handle requests until termination is
  # requested. Enabling debug lets you see request logs and stack traces.
  app.run(debug=True)
  ```

The source code for all the examples can be found in [examples directory](https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/tree/master/examples).

Run it
------

On Linux and OSX run the server with just: `python3 hello.py`.

If using Docker run `docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/hello.py:/hello.py japronto/japronto --script /hello.py`. This will mount local `hello.py` into container as `/hello.py` which is later passed to Docker entry point.

Now open the address `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. You should see the message *Hello world!*.

You now have a working Japronto server!
