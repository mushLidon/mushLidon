# Japronto!

Japronto (from Portuguese "j√° pronto" meaning "already done") is a __screaming-fast__, __scalable__
Python 3.5+ web __micro-framework__ integrated with __pipelining HTTP server__
based on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [picohttpparser](https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser).

Performance
-----------

Here comes a chart to help you imagine what kind of things you can do with Japronto:

![Requests per second](benchmarks/results.png)

These results of a simple "Hello world" application were obtained on AWS c4.2xlarge instance. To be fair all the contestants (including Go) were running single worker process. Servers were load tested using [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) with 1 thread, 100 connections and 24 simultaneous (pipelined) requests per connection.

The source code for the benchmark can be found in [benchmarks](benchmarks) directory.

The server is written in hand tweaked C trying to take advantage of modern CPUs. It relies on picohttpparser for header &
chunked-encoding parsing while uvloop provides asynchronous I/O. It also tries to save up on
system calls by combining writes together when possible.
